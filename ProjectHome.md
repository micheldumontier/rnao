The central aim of the RNA Ontology Consortium (ROC) is to develop an ontology to capture all aspects of RNA - from primary sequence to alignments, secondary and tertiary structure from base pairing and base stacking to sophisticated motifs.

The RNA ontology can be downloaded as
  * [OWL](http://rnao.googlecode.com/svn/tags/RNAO-1.0/rnao.owl)
  * [OBO](http://rnao.googlecode.com/svn/tags/RNAO-1.0/rnao.obo)
  * [SPASS](http://rnao.googlecode.com/svn/tags/RNAO-1.0/rnao.spass)
